**Introduction**

Entity Wallet is a blockchain-based wallet solution that leverages the principles of account abstraction (EIP 4337) to enable a master wallet to manage transactions and gas payments on behalf of its child wallets.

The Entity Wallet aims to provide a secure and user-friendly experience for managing cryptocurrency assets, while also addressing the limitations of traditional cryptocurrency wallets.

**Problem Statement:** 

Managing cryptocurrency transactions and ensuring the security of private keys can be challenging and complex for end users, especially those with limited blockchain knowledge. Additionally, traditional wallet solutions often lack user-friendly recovery processes for users who lose access to their account credentials. There is a need for a secure, user-friendly, and scalable wallet solution that simplifies transaction management, offers seamless recovery processes, and provides a high level of security to protect users' assets.


**Usage**

To use the Entity Wallet web application, please follow these steps:
1. Log in to the Entity Wallet using your Ethereum wallet.
2. Create child wallets within the Entity Wallet.
3. Send and receive transactions using the child wallets.
4. The master wallet will manage gas fees on behalf of the child wallets, making transactions more cost-effective.
5. In the event that a child wallet loses access to their social login/smart contract account, they can recover their funds through the Entity Wallet.
